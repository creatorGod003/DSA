strongly polynomial algorithm will be polynomial time algorithm which increases based on number of inputs. 
Weakly polynomial algorithm will be polynomial time and depend on size of input values. 

For example, we have list of elements 
	
	if algo 1 runs in polynomial time and its runtime increases based on size of list then it is strongly polynomial algorithm.
	if algo 2 run in polynomial time and its runtime increases based on size of item in list then it is weakly polynomial algorithm
